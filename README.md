# Automatic-Music-Tagging-CNN

Here you will find code and description of a CNN model that was used to build a music tagging system--the final project of myself and another classmate for Dr. Juan Bello's Music Info Retrieval course: https://wp.nyu.edu/jpbello/teaching/mir/

NOTES:
1. The project contains files for "CNN", "Database_processing_code","KNN" and "Random_forest" codes.
2. The "CNN" folder contains the code used to train and test the network. 
3. "Database_processing_code" contains the python code used to generate the three different normalized data. It also contains the code used to generate the sorted list of tags.
4. "KNN" contains the code used to train the K-Nearest Neighbours as a baseline.
5. "Random_forest" contains the code used to train the Random Forest as a baseline.
6. Have not included the raw or the processed data here. Contact if you want.
7. Have also not attached the trained model parameters here.
