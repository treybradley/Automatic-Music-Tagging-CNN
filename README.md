1. The project contains files for "CNN", "Database_processing_code","KNN" and "Random_forest" codes.
2. The "CNN" folder contains the code used to train and test the network. 
3. "Database_processing_code" contains the python code used to generate the three different normalized data. It also contains the code used to generate the sorted list of tags.
4. "KNN" contains the code used to train the K-Nearest Neighbours as a baseline.
5. "Random_forest" contains the code used to train the Random Forest as a baseline.
6. Have not included the raw or the processed data here. Contact if you want.
